# AdventOfCode2022

My implementation for AdventOfCode2022.

Problems can be found at: https://adventofcode.com/2022

If you would like to run the code, make sure to first go to the folder that contains the python file and input file.
Then simply run `python filename.py`.

At least Python 3.10 is needed to run everything.
